# Introduction

The data warehouse landscape is experiencing a tectonic shift. After decades of dominance by traditional **vendor-locked solutions**, a new way of thinking is emerging: **_data warehouses built on open table formats_**. This architectural approach isn't just another incremental improvement—it represents a fundamental reimagining of how organizations store, manage, and analyze their critical data assets.

Open table formats like **Apache Iceberg, Delta Lake, and Apache Hudi** are transforming what's possible in data warehousing. By decoupling storage from compute and leveraging cloud-native technologies, these formats enable data architectures that are more flexible, cost-effective, and powerful than their traditional counterparts.

In my years working at various companies I've witnessed firsthand how legacy data warehouse architectures strain under modern data volumes and velocity especially under the new wave of AI. The limitations become increasingly apparent: rigid schemas, costly scaling, vendor lock-in, and separation between analytical and operational workloads.
