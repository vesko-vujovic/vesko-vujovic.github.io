# Introduction

Picture this: Your marketing team needs customer data for an upcoming campaign. You submit a request to IT, initiating a complex process that **involves multiple teams, approval chains, and coordination across departments.** The request joins a backlog of similar requests, each requiring data team resources.

This scenario plays out daily in enterprises worldwide. What should be simple data requests turn into lengthy processes that can stretch for **weeks or months.**

The bottleneck isn't technicalâ€”it's organizational. With exploding data volumes across enterprises, traditional request-based models simply can't keep pace with business needs. The solution? 

Self-service analytics powered by modern data catalogs that put data directly into the hands of those who need it while maintaining proper governance.

In this post, we'll explore how data catalogs are transforming enterprise data access from lengthy, multi-stage approval processes to efficient self-service experiences.
