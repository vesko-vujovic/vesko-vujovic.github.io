What if I told you that you could run vector searches directly on S3 without spinning up a single database or compute cluster? For years, we've been stuck with a painful pipeline: extract data from S3, chunk it, generate embeddings, load everything into **OpenSearch or Pinecone**, and manage all that infrastructure. 

Amazon just changed the game with S3 Vectors â€“ it's S3 that can do vector math natively, no compute engine required. This means up to **90% cost savings and zero infrastructure management**. Let me show you exactly how this works and why it might replace your vector database entirely.


# The Old Way: Why Vector Storage Was a Pain ðŸ˜“

Picture the traditional vector search architecture: Your data sits in S3, then you need an embedding application to chunk and vectorize it, followed by a vector database like OpenSearch or Pinecone, and finally your application queries that database.

Each step is a potential failure point â€“ managing chunking strategies, handling batch processing, dealing with failed embeddings, and orchestrating everything with Lambda or ECS.

The costs are brutal. OpenSearch runs you **$700+/month minimum** for a production cluster, plus you're managing index allocation, shard management, and capacity planning. You're essentially paying twice â€“ once for S3 storage and again for vector database storage and compute â€“ all just to run similarity searches on data that was already sitting in S3.
