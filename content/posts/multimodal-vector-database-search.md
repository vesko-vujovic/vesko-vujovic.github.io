# Introduction: Reinventing E-commerce Search Beyond Keywords

_Have you ever struggled to find a product online because you couldn't quite describe what you were looking for in words? Perhaps you saw a jacket you liked on social media but couldn't articulate its style, or maybe you wanted something "similar to this but more professional-looking." Traditional keyword-based search engines fall short in these scenarios._

In this blog post, I'll guide you through building a powerful multimodal product search engine using **vector databases.** 

You'll learn how to create a system that can understand both "I want something that looks like this" and "but make sure it's waterproof and suitable for hiking"‚Äîcombining the best of both worlds.

By the end of this tutorial, you'll have created a search engine that:

- Finds visually similar products from reference images
- Understands natural language queries about product attributes
- Combines both capabilities for truly intuitive product discovery

# Understanding Vector Search Fundamentals
Before we write any code, let's understand the foundational concepts behind vector search.

## What Are Vector Embeddings?
At their core, vector embeddings are a way to represent complex data (like images or text) as lists of numbers.

// HERE CREATE SOME NICE IMAGE OF VECTORS 

These numerical representations capture semantic meaning in a way that machines can understand.
Think of vectors as coordinates in a multi-dimensional space. Items with similar meaning or appearance end up close to each other in this space. For example:

The vectors for "running shoes" and "jogging sneakers" would be nearby
An image of a red t-shirt would be close to another red t-shirt in vector space

This numerical representation allows us to quantify similarity‚Äîthe closer two vectors are, the more similar the items they represent.

## How Similarity Search Works

Once we have data represented as vectors, finding similar items becomes a mathematical problem‚Äîspecifically, finding the nearest neighbors in vector space. This is typically measured using distance functions like:

- **Cosine similarity:** Measures the angle between vectors, ignoring magnitude
- **Euclidean distance:** Measures the straight-line distance between vector points
- **Dot product:** Another way to calculate how similar two vectors are

// add images for this

Most vector databases use specialized algorithms and indexing techniques like **HNSW (Hierarchical Navigable Small World)** to make these nearest-neighbor searches incredibly fast, even with millions of vectors.

# Multimodal Vectors: The Power of Combination

The real magic happens when we combine vectors from different modalities (like images and text). This allows us to create search experiences that understand both what products look like and what they mean conceptually.

For example, a customer could:

- Upload an image of a blue denim jacket
- Add text like "but in black leather"
- Our system would find items that visually resemble the jacket but match the textual description

This kind of intuitive search simply isn't possible with traditional keyword approaches.
