# Introduction

The data warehouse landscape is experiencing a tectonic shift. After decades of dominance by traditional **vendor-locked solutions**, a new way of thinking is emerging: **_data warehouses built on open table formats_**. This architectural approach isn't just another incremental improvement‚Äîit represents a fundamental reimagining of how organizations store, manage, and analyze their critical data assets.

Open table formats like **Apache Iceberg, Delta Lake, and Apache Hudi** are transforming what's possible in data warehousing. By decoupling storage from compute and leveraging cloud-native technologies, these formats enable data architectures that are more flexible, cost-effective, and powerful than their traditional counterparts.

In my years working at various companies I've witnessed firsthand how legacy data warehouse architectures strain under modern data volumes and velocity especially under the new wave of AI. The limitations become increasingly apparent: rigid schemas, costly scaling, vendor lock-in, and separation between analytical and operational workloads.

This blog post explores why data warehouses backed by open table formats aren't just an alternative to traditional data warehouses‚Äîthey're poised to replace them entirely. 

Let's start by exploring how we got here, looking at the evolution of data warehousing and the limitations that have set the stage for this revolution.

#  The Evolution of Data Warehousing

Data warehousing has undergone several major transformations since its inception in the late 1980s. Understanding this evolution provides crucial context for appreciating why open table formats represent such a significant leap forward.

## The Traditional Data Warehouse Era
The first generation of data warehouses emerged as businesses needed a way to consolidate operational data for analytical purposes. These on-premises systems, dominated by vendors like Teradata, Oracle, and IBM, introduced the concept of storing data in specialized structures optimized for analytical queries rather than transaction processing.
While revolutionary at the time, these traditional data warehouses came with significant limitations:

- **Costly infrastructure:** Organizations had to purchase and maintain expensive proprietary hardware.
- **Rigid scaling:** Adding capacity meant purchasing more physical servers and storage.
- **Schema complexity:** Changes to data models required careful planning and often resulted in downtime.
- **Limited concurrency:** Supporting many simultaneous users required significant hardware investments.
- **Vendor lock-in:** Proprietary formats and tools created dependency on specific vendors.
