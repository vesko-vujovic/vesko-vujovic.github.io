# Introduction

Have you ever wondered how Pinterest finds visually **similar images** or how Google Photos recognizes faces across thousands of pictures? The technology that powers these features isn't magic‚Äîit's vector similarity search. Today, modern vector databases make it possible for developers to build these powerful visual search capabilities without needing a PhD in computer vision.


In this post, I'll guide you through the process of building your own **image similarity search engine**. We'll cover everything from understanding vector embeddings to implementing a working solution that can find visually similar images in milliseconds.
