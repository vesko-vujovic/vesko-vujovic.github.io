# The Problem: Union function isn't as Simple as it Seems

Picture this: You have a large dataset that you need to process in different ways, so you:

- Split it into smaller pieces
- Transform each piece differently
- Put them back together using union

Sounds straightforward, right? Well, there's a catch that most developers don't know about.

# The Hidden Performance Killer üêå

Here's what's actually happening behind the scenes when you use `union`:

```scala

    // Create two dataframes from 1 to 1000000
    val df1 = spark.range(10000000).toDF("value")
    val df2 = spark.range(10000000).toDF("value")

    // Perform inner join
    val df = df1.join(df2, Seq("value"), "inner")

    // Split into odd and even numbers
    val dfOdd = df.filter(col("value") % 2 === 1)
    val dfEven = df.filter(col("value") % 2 === 0)

    val dfOddAdded = dfOdd.withColumn("add_value", col("value") + 1)
    val dfEvenDivided = dfEven.withColumn("divide_value", col("value") / 2)

    // Union and count
    val result = dfOddAdded.union(dfEvenDivided).count()

    // Print the result
    println(s"Total count: $result")

    // Optional: Show the execution plan
    dfOddWithMagic.union(dfEvenDivided).explain("formatted")

```

When Spark sees this code, it doesn't realize it can reuse data. Instead, it goes back to the beginning and processes your entire pipeline again for each part of the union!

Think of it like running an entire production line twice to make identical toys, just to paint half of them red and half blue. Instead, you could run the production line once and split the toys for different paint jobs at the end!

Look at this execution plan, we see **twice the same part of the plan** i.e. **union operation will trigger the recomputation**:

# The Simple Fix: Cache is Your Friend!‚ö°

Here's how to make your unions lightning fast:

```scala 

    val df = df1.join(df2, Seq("value"), "inner")
    df.cache()

```


By adding `cache()`, you're telling Spark: "Hey, keep this data in memory - we'll need it again soon!"

Now imagine these scenarios:
- You have **billions** of records to process üòß
- Your job is running on AWS Glue where you pay per DPU hour üí∞
- Without caching, you're essentially:
  - Processing those billions of records twice
  - Doubling your computation time
  - Doubling your AWS costs üî•

The cost impact is real:
- 2x processing time = 2x DPU hours
- 2x DPU hours = 2x your bill

This is why understanding caching isn't just about performance‚Äîit's about your bottom line! üí°
