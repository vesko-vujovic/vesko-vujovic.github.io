# Introduction

Have you ever wondered how Pinterest finds visually **similar images** or how Google Photos recognizes faces across thousands of pictures? The technology that powers these features isn't magic‚Äîit's vector similarity search. Today, modern vector databases make it possible for developers to build these powerful visual search capabilities without needing a PhD in computer vision.


In this post, I'll guide you through the process of building your own **image similarity search engine**. We'll cover everything from understanding vector embeddings to implementing a working solution that can find visually similar images in milliseconds.

# Understanding Vector Embeddings for Images
Before we dive into the implementation details, let's understand what vector embeddings are and why they're crucial for image similarity search.

## What is vector?

A **vector** is a simple mathematical idea that describes something with both a size (how much) and a direction (which way). Think of a vector like an arrow: the length of the arrow shows how big it is, and the way it points shows the direction.

#### Everyday Example
Imagine you‚Äôre giving someone directions:

‚ÄúWalk 3 steps forward and 4 steps to the right.‚Äù

This instruction can be shown as an arrow from where you start to where you end up. That arrow is a vector: it tells you both how far to go (the magnitude) and which way to go (the direction)

3 steps forward would be the magnitude of a vector and direction would be 4 steps to the right

## What Are Vector Embeddings?

Vector embeddings are numerical representations of data in multi-dimensional space. For images, these embeddings capture visual features like shapes, textures, colors, and objects within a fixed-length vector (typically hundreds or thousands of dimensions).

The beauty of vector embeddings is that similar images will have vectors that are closer to each other in this high-dimensional space. This geometric property allows us to find similar images by measuring the distance between vectors.
